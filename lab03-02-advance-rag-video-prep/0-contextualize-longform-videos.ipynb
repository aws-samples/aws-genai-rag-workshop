    "# Achieve video understanding using Generative AI on AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop focuses on contextualizing long-form video assets, which are among the most challenging media types to analyze. We will systematically demonstrate how to break down lengthy videos into logical segments and then generate relevant insights for each segment using generative AI on AWS. This process enables a granular understanding of long-form video content at the scene level. By completing this workshop, you will learn our video understanding techniques that allow users not only to comprehend and quickly find specific videos but also to understand and identify relevant scenes or clips within those videos."

    "3. In parallel, generate scene grid from video frames: we sample the frames from video and use Amazon Titan Multimodal Embedding model to help group frames into shots and then group shots into scenes based on visual similarity.\n",
    "4. Align scene and audio chapter: align video scenes with the audio chapters to identify un-intrusive breaks for ad insertion\n",
    "5. Generate the contextual response: We send the the scene grid, transcription, to Anthropic Claude 3 model in Amazon Bedrock to generate relevant contextual response: such as scene description, sentiment, relevant IAB or any other custom taxonomy.\n",

    "In this section, we will sample the frames from the video and use Amazon Titan Multimodal Embedding (TME) model to help group frames into shots and then group shots into scenes based on visual similarity. Each frame from a scene is used to create a single composite image or \"scene grid\" that can be used as an input to Amazon Bedrock to understand the scene. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this process, we first sample one frame per second, then employ a cosine similarity logic on the adjacent frames to group frame images into shots, which represent camera shot change events. We chose one frame per second for downsampling based on past experiences, but this can be calibrated if you have high-motion, high-frame-rate videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even after identifying individual camera shots, there may still be too many semantically similar shots depicting the same setting. To further cluster these into distinct scenes, we need to expand our frame comparison beyond just adjacent frames. By looking at similar frames across an expanded time window, we can identify shots that are likely part of the same contiguous scene. We calculate pairwise similarity scores between all frames within a given time window. Frames with similarity scores above a certain threshold are considered part of the same scene group. This process is performed recursively across all frames in a shot. The time window size and similarity threshold are calibrated parameters that can significantly impact scene boundary detection accuracy. In our example, we found a 3-minute time window and 0.85 similarity threshold gave the best scene clustering results across our video samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, this scene grouping process is accomplished by first indexing all video frames using TME again and storing the embeddings along with their shot information and timestamps into a vector database, as illustrated in the figure below.  For this notebok, we are using a FAIS vector store to manage embedding locally, but you can use any vector store.  The implementation in Solution Guidance for Media2Cloud on AWS uses Amazon Open Search Serverless for this purpose.\n",

    "At this point, we have separately processed the visual and audio cues from the video. Now, we bring them together and ensure that the transcription chapters align with the scene breaks. The last thing you want is to insert an ad during an ongoing conversation or scene. To create alignment, we will iterate over each conversational chapter, represented by its start and end timestamps, and a text description summarizing the topic. For each chapter, the code identifies the relevant video scenes that overlap or fall within the chapter's timestamp range. The output of this process is a list of chapters, where each chapter contains a list of scene IDs representing the video scenes that align with the corresponding audio conversation. After the alignment process, we have combined visual and audio cues into the final chapters. The breaks we identified are what the system suggested as ideal places for ad insertion. In real-world applications, we recommend surfacing these breaks as suggestions to the operator and having a human-in-the-loop step to confirm the final breaks.\n"

    "The last step is to send both the visually and audio-aligned data to Claude 3 Haiku to generate contextual information for each chapter. This is an innovative approach that takes advantage of the multimodal capabilities of the Claude 3 family of models. From our testing, these models have demonstrated the ability to capture minute details from large images and follow image sequences when provided with appropriate instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the input for Claude3 Haiku, we first assemble video frames associated with each chapter and create a composite image grid. Through our experimentation, we have found that the optimum image grid ratio is 7 rows by 4 columns, which will assemble a **1568 x 1540 pixel image** that fits under Claude's 5 MB image file size limit while still preserving enough detail in each individual frame tile. Furthermore, you can also assemble multiple images if needed.\n",

    "<img src=\"static/scene-grid.png\" width=\"50%\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, the composite images and transcription are fed into the prompt to generate descriptions, sentiment, and other relevant information in a single query to the Claude3 Haiku model. Not only that, but we can adapt this approach to any taxonomy or custom labeling use cases without the need to train a model each time. This is where the true power of this approach lies. The final output can be presented to a human reviewer for final confirmation if needed. Here is an example of a composite image grid and the corresponding contextual output for a specific chapter."
